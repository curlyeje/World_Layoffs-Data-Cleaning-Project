This project was completed in My SQL Workbench. The World_Layoffs Data consisted of 480 companies from December 2022 - March 2023. These companies had to layoff their employees with respect to each company. I wanted to answer the following questions. 1. What companies did 100% layoffs? 2. What was the highest amount of employees laid off? 3. What Industries were negatively impacted by total employees laid off? 4. What countries were negatively impacted by total employees laid off? 5. What was the rolling total of layoffs from December 2022 to March 2023? In order to answer these questions and present these compelling results, I had to first go through the Data Cleaning Process. These steps involved removing duplicates, standardizing the data, removing NULL or blank values as necessary, and removing any unnecessary columns. After the Data Cleaning Stage, the data then went into the Exploratory Data Analysis Stage. The Exploratory Data Analysis answered the following questions: 
1. There were a total of 18 companies that did 100% employee layoffs.
2. Google came in at number 1 reaching 12,000 employees laid off.
3. The top 3 industries that were negatively impacted by total employee layoffs were other, consumer, and retail.
4. The top 3 countries that were negatively impacted by total employee layoffs were United States, Sweden, and Netherlands.
5. The rolling total of layoffs from December 2022 - March 2023 was 134,310.
